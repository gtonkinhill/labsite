Zunair is a current PhD student in the Tonkin-Hill Lab investigating longitudinal metagenomics. He completed a BBmed, majoring in Human Structure and Function, in 2022 and a Master of Public Health, specialising in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, in 2024, both at the University of Melbourne. During his PhD he has been investigating methods of estimating within-host mutation rates of commensal bacteria from longitudinal metagenomic data. He is interested in the intersection between bioinformatics, biostatistics, and public health.
