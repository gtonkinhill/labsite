Based at the [Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre](https://www.petermac.org/) and the [Peter Doherty Institute](https://www.doherty.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne, Australia, the Computational Microbiology group, led by Gerry Tonkin-Hill, works closely with clinical and wet-lab collaborators to improve our understanding of how microbes evolve, transmit between and interact with their hosts. 

These microbial interactions play a critical role in our health and can have profound impacts on the treatment of both infectious and non-infectious diseases, including cancer. Accurate models of these interactions will help to create optimal microbiome-targeted therapies and mitigate the impact of infectious disease.
