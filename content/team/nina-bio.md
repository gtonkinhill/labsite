For the past seven years, first as a PhD student and now as a postdoctoral fellow, my research has examined how cancer chemotherapeutic drugs affect Escherichia coli, with particular emphasis on their potential role in driving the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I was introduced to AMR research as a master’s student investigating de novo gene origination using AMR as a selection tool – an experience that sparked my long-standing interest in the evolutionary dynamics of resistance.
